# Save The Manuals
#### Manual transmission cars are a dying breed in the U.S. You might be thinking, who cares? Unfortunately, car enthusiasts do.

Car enthusiasts enjoy manual transmission cars. Finding them is difficult. Fortunately, this website makes it easy.

## How It Works

#### Data
There are 2 main procedures in compiling the data. Both are executed in the same **Python** script. The first is the initial web-scraping, using [**BeautifulSoup4**](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [**Requests**](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/), and the second is revision with [**Requests-HTML**](https://requests.readthedocs.io/projects/requests-html/en/latest/). The revision is necessary as some of the cars in the initial scraping are innacurate. The script runs on a regular schedule to ensure fresh data. Though both procedures are complaint with their resource's robots.txt rules, the actual websites scraped and used for revision will remain anonymous.

#### Website
Created using the [**MERN**](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) stack and  [**deployed on Heroku**](https://guarded-cliffs-55345.herokuapp.com/). The database resides on a [**MongoDB Atlas**](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_americas_united_states_search_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=mongo%20atlas&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=1718986498&gclid=CjwKCAjwiaX8BRBZEiwAQQxGx6BiZhzlWdyuhOUEGXpkvaL28TYMPg5S9fETP_YUlFTGLD_QPNgLZRoCEbkQAvD_BwE) server.
